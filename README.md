# Real-Time-drowsiness-detection-system-for-safe-driving
Drowsy Driving is a dangerous combo of driving and being sleepy. The frequency of traffic accidents caused by drowsy driving is rising at an alarming rate around the world. The biggest cause of tiredness while driving is a lack of sleep and fatigue. This project aims to solve this problem by taking advantage of Machine Vision.


Recently, driver drowsiness and fatigue has become one of the principal causes of traffic crashes; it can prompt many deaths, wounds, and many economic losses. Therefore, the use of a system that takes into account the driver's level of vigilance can play an important role in preventing accidents and saving human lives. In this work, we propose Real Time drowsiness detection system for safe driving. This system can detect drowsiness by identifying microsleep, which corresponds to a sleepiness lasting more than 2 seconds, using eye closure analysis. In cases of drowsiness, an alert is launched to make the driver vigilant and thus definitely avoid road accidents, decrease the percentage of accidents and injuries caused by driver hypovigilance, and save many human lives in the process

We aim to develop a system that can detect and alert drivers who are at risk of falling asleep while driving. This system would use a combination of technologies such as computer vision, machine learning, and biometrics to monitor a driver's behavior and physiological indicators. we are hoping to conduct mock experiments to demonstrate our proposed solution.

The system in real life would include cameras and sensors installed in the vehicle that would monitor the driver's face, eye movements, and other biometric signals such as heart rate and skin conductivity. The data collected from these sensors would be analyzed in real-time using machine learning algorithms to detect signs of fatigue and drowsiness.

In the event that the system detects a high risk of the driver falling asleep, it would trigger an alert, such as a visual or auditory warning, to the driver to take a break and rest. The system could also be integrated with vehicle systems to limit the speed of the vehicle or to activate driver-assist features if necessary.

The goal of this project is to reduce the number of accidents caused by drowsy driving and to improve the safety of road users. The system would be particularly useful for long-distance drivers, commercial truckers, and other high-risk groups who spend a lot of time behind the wheel
